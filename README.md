# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
Analyzed pizza sales data using MySQL. Imported the CSV files in MySQL Workbench. I was able to gain insights on the data key metrics and trends. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights, identifying popular pizzas, peak order times, and revenue distribution.
